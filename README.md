# PreprocessImage

This project is a part of the OCR solution I built while at Deloitte. All the image data is produced by developers and doesn't involve any sensitive information. 

This algo aims to crop from any images and obtain the proper contract form from the image. It has the ability to take in all kinds of noisy images.
